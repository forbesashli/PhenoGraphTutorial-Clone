The following package is a loose tutorial in how to use PhenoGraph. Complete with notebook files for both 2D and 3D data labelled accordingly as well as function files stored seperately for cleanliness. It is recommended that these scripts be run in a place that has higher with at least 16 GB of ram in order to produce the images.
